# Deep Q-Network for Banana Navigation Environment

## Environment
This project utilizes the Unityu ML agent Banana environment to build a reinforcement learning agent. The agent is built using a deep Q-network, with the objective of only collecting yellow bananas, not blue ones. The agent is rewarded accordingly (+1 points for yellow bananas and -1 for blue).

The state space has 37 dimensions including velocity and ray-based perception of objects relative to the agent's forward direction. The agent can select from 4 possible actions (forward, backward, left and right).

The environment is considered solved when the agent obtains an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes for this episodic task.
